Sure, here's an example of how you can pass data from View Controller 1 (VC1) to View Controller 2 (VC2) using a segue with identifier "vc2":

In VC1, assuming you have some data you want to pass:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController1: UIViewController {

    var dataToPass: String = "Hello VC2!"

    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
        if segue.identifier == "vc2" {
            if let vc2 = segue.destination as? ViewController2 {
                vc2.receivedData = dataToPass
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In VC2:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController2: UIViewController {

    var receivedData: String = ""

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Use receivedData here
        print(receivedData) // Just an example to show you how to use the received data
    }
}
```

Make sure to set the segue identifier in your storyboard by selecting the segue between VC1 and VC2, and setting its identifier to "vc2".

This way, when the segue is triggered, the `prepare(for:sender:)` method in VC1 will be called, where you can set the `receivedData` property in VC2 to the data you want to pass. Then, when VC2 loads, it will have access to the data through the `receivedData` property.
